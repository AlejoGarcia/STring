The first fence claimed Perfect Candidate who 
in turn brought down one of the favourites, 
Blaklion. I Just Know led the field until falling 
at Becher's Brook, which also saw Houblon Des 
Obleaux and Virgilio out of the race. Houblon 
Des Obeaux's jockey Charlie Deutsch was treated 
for injuries at the scene, resulting in Becher's 
being bypassed on the second circuit. Captain
Redbeard unseated its rider at the Foinavon fence 
as Ucello Conti led the field from Double Ross, 
with The Dutchman, Milansbar and Pleasant Company 
also prominent. The Canal Turn saw the end of
Lord Windermere, Buywise and Final Nudge.
Chase The Spud pulled up before The Chair,
which claimed Alpha Des Obeaux and Saint Are.
